# DS3022-Final-Project
Student Exam Score Project

In the context of my research centered on predicting academic performance, I assessed a dataset of student scores to calculate to gain valuable insights on what factors affect student achievement. After data preparation and exploratory analysis, I ensured the dataset's integrity and gleaned preliminary insights. Subsequently, I executed a series of data preprocessing techniques, orchestrating the transformation of raw information into a coherent and analyzable format. This paved the way for a visual exploration, where graphical representations were utilized to uncover patterns and potential interrelationships within the dataset. This groundwork culminated in the development of predictive models. By extrapolating patterns discerned from the data, these computational models hold promise for informing educational strategies and illuminating influential factors shaping student achievenment.
